<h2 id="establish-trust-between-a-big-iq-centralized-management-system-and-a-big-ip-device">Establish trust between a BIG-IQ Centralized Management system and a BIG-IP device</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>You can use the REST API to establish trust between the BIG-IQ Centralized Management system and BIG-IP devices so that the BIG-IQ Centralized Management system can manage, and communicate with, the BIG-IP device. This trust establishment example also shows how to upgrade the REST framework for a BIG-IP device version 12.0.0 or lower.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>This example assumes the following about the configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>All BIG-IP devices are operational and have the services provisioned that will be managed by the BIG-IQ Centralized Management system.</li>
<li>The BIG-IQ Centralized Management system is operational, has completed the setup wizard and has all system-level configuration in place.</li>
<li>When performing the tasks in this example, review the listed IP addresses and change them as appropriate for your environment. For example, if you are not running the script directly on the BIG-IQ system, you should change localhost to be the IP address of the BIG-IQ Centralized Management system.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>You establish the trust between the BIG-IQ Centralized Management system and the BIG-IP device as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Perform a GET method on the machineid-resolver URI to determine the current state of the BIG-IP device. Using this information, you can determine the management status of the BIG-IP device.</li>
<li>Perform a POST method on the trust URI to create the trust between the BIG-IQ Centralized Management system and the BIG-IP device.</li>
<li>Monitor the task via GET methods until the status has a value of FINISHED, FAILED or CANCELLED.</li>
<li>If needed, perform a PATCH method to the task with the necessary root credentials to support a framework upgrade. You perform the patch when the status has a value of FINISHED and the currentStep value indicates a framework upgrade is required.</li>
<li>Perform GET methods to monitor the trust task until the status has a value of FINISHED, FAILED or CANCELLED.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following extended example show each of these REST API methods.</p>
<h3 id="extended-example-for-establishing-device-trust">Extended example for establishing device trust</h3>
<p>In the following example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The BIG-IP device discovery address is 10.255.4.124. you can substitute your BIG-IP device’s discovery address for this address when you implement the example.<br />
</li>
<li>The BIG-IP device is in a DSC cluster with another BIG-IP device which has a discovery address of 10.255.4.125. The trust relationship with the clustered BIG-IP device is established later and is not covered in this example.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="determine-the-current-status-of-the-big-ip-device-on-the-big-iq-centralized-management-system.">1. Determine the current status of the BIG-IP device on the BIG-IQ Centralized Management system.</h4>
<p>Perform a GET method on the machineid-resolver to determine if the BIG-IP device already has trust established. You will want to use the filter option to narrow the returned JSON information to just this particular BIG-IP device. If the value of items is not an empty list [], then the trust has already been established.</p>
<pre><code>GET: https://&lt;mgmtip&gt;/mgmt/cm/system/machineid-resolver?$filter=(&#39;address&#39;+eq+&#39;10.255.4.124&#39;)</code></pre>

<p>Perform a POST method to the trust task URI. The following options must be included in the POST JSON data: - address - The discovery address for the BIG-IP device. - clusterName - The name to be used to label the DSC cluster if this BIG-IP device is part of a DSC cluster. - useBigiqSync - The mode to be used for synchronizing the DSC cluster. It is highly recommended that this be included and set to false so that the BIG-IP devices will perform the necessary syncing of the cluster. - userName - The user name for the account that has admin privileges on the BIG-IP device. - password - The password associated with the userName on the BIG-IP device.</p>
